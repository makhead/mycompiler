# mycompiler
This is the final project of Computational theory at Zhejiang University.

## Description
This is a C-like compiler built by flex, bison and llvm.
The C-like language is a weaker version of C language.

We have implemented the following features in this C-like language:
* Arithmetic calculations
* Logical calculations
* If-Else statements
* Loops
* Function Call

## Steps to compile and run the program
